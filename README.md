# GameCI

Documentation for open source GameCI projects. You can find the `.md` files inside the
[docs](./docs) folder. The live version is available on [game.ci](https://game.ci). This website is
built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are
reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.
