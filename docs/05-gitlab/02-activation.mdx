# Activation

:::caution Having issues with activation?

Check out the [Troubleshooting / Common Issues][common-issues] section.

:::

:::info

Refer to
[Unity's official licensing documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LicensesAndActivation.html)
for more details about Unity activation.

:::

To run Unity in a CI/CD pipeline, you need to activate your license. For details about how the
activation process works, refer to the following scripts:

- [`ci/before_script.sh`](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/blob/main/ci/before_script.sh)
- [`ci/after_script.sh`](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/blob/main/ci/after_script.sh)

In this guide, we will cover

- Activation methods for different license types.
- Setting up your Unity license in GitLab CI/CD.

## Choosing the Right Activation Method

To activate Unity, select the method that matches your license type.

- If you're using the **free version**, follow the steps for a
  [Personal License](#personal-license).
- If you're using a **paid** Unity subscription (Plus/Pro), see
  [Professional License](#professional-license).
- If your organization has a **license server**, see [License Server](#license-server).

## Personal License

Follow these steps **if you are using the free version** of Unity and do **not** have a serial from
a paid plan. However, note that **Unity Personal** licenses produce a **“serial”** token in the
`.ulf` file.

The activation process for Unity Personal licenses is as follows:

1. **Activate locally** with Unity Hub on your machine and **Locate the `.ulf`** (see the
   OS-specific paths).
2. **Extract the serial** from the `.ulf` file.
3. **Store** serial and Unity credentials in GitLab’s CI/CD Variables:
   - `UNITY_SERIAL` (extracted from `.ulf`)
   - `UNITY_EMAIL`
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD`

### 1. Setting Up Your Unity License

1. **Install Unity Hub**: Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) on your local
   machine.
2. **Log in to Unity Hub**: Use the Unity account linked to your CI setup to log in. Ensure you're
   using the correct account to activate the intended license.
3. **Activate Your License**: Manually activate by navigating to:

   - `Unity Hub` > `Preferences` > `Licenses` and click the `Add` button
   - Select **Get a free personal license**.

   :::info Ensure File Creation

   Even if a license appears in Unity Hub, a `.ulf` file may not have been created. To ensure the
   file is generated, make sure to click the `Add` button and proceed with the activation steps. Do
   not skip this step.

   <img
     src={unityHubPreferencesLicensesAddButton}
     alt="Unity Hub interface showing the Preferences window with the Licenses tab selected and the Add button highlighted"
   />

4. **Locate the `.ulf` file**: Depending on your operating system, the Unity license file will be
   located in one of these paths:

   - Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`
   - Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`

If you have trouble locating the `.ulf` file, follow these steps:

- **Check activation**: Ensure you’ve logged into Unity Hub and completed the step "3. Activate Your
  License".
- **Reveal hidden files**: These folders may be hidden by default, so enable the option to view
  hidden files in your file explorer.
- **Use any platform**: Licenses are not tied to a specific Unity version or platform. You can
  activate the license on any operating system, such as Windows, and use it for builds on another
  platform, like Ubuntu. Simply retrieve the `.ulf` file from the platform most convenient for you.

### 2. Extracting the Serial from a personal license

1. **Extract your Unity serial** from the `.ulf` file:

   This command decodes the internal `DeveloperData` field to reveal the **serial** used for
   activation (even for Personal).

   On macOS or Linux:

   ```bash
   cat Unity_lic.ulf | grep DeveloperData | sed -E 's/.*Value="([^"]+)".*/\1/' | base64 --decode
   ```

   On Windows using Powershell:

   ```powershell
   Get-Content Unity_lic.ulf | Select-String -Pattern 'DeveloperData' | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match 'Value="([^"]+)"') {
        $base64String = $matches[1]
        [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($base64String))
    }
   }
   ```

:::info Expected Serial Format

The serial should look like this: `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`.

:::

### 3. Storing the Serial in GitLab CI/CD

**Add the extracted serial** to your GitLab project’s CI/CD Variables:

- `UNITY_SERIAL`: The serial extracted from the `.ulf` file
- `UNITY_EMAIL`: The email address associated with your Unity account
- `UNITY_PASSWORD`: The password for your Unity account

:::info Variables are not set in your pipelines?

Make sure you unchecked the "protected" checkbox for these variables if you want them to be
available for all branches and merge requests.

:::

:::caution Security Warning

Keep your extracted serial and credentials secure. Never commit them to version control or share
them publicly.

:::

You're all set! The pipeline will use these credentials to activate Unity automatically. 🎉

---

## Professional License

If you have **Unity Plus** or **Unity Pro**, you have an **official serial key** from
[Unity subscriptions](https://id.unity.com/en/subscriptions). For **GitLab**:

1. **Get your serial** (format: `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`).
2. **Go to** _Settings → CI/CD → Variables_ in your GitLab project:
   - `UNITY_SERIAL`
   - `UNITY_EMAIL`
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD`

:::info Using "protected" variables will make them available only to protected branches

Make sure you unchecked the "protected" checkbox for these variables if you want them to be
available for all branches and merge requests.

:::

:::caution Security Warning

Keep your extracted serial and credentials secure. Never commit them to version control or share
them publicly.

:::

You're all set! The pipeline will use these credentials to activate Unity automatically. 🎉

---

## License Server

If your organization uses a **floating license server**, you can supply a server URL with the
environment variable `UNITY_LICENSING_SERVER` in your GitLab variables. The pipeline (via
`before_script.sh`) automatically tries to **acquire** a floating license at the start of the job
and **return** it after. For example:

```yaml
variables:
  UNITY_LICENSING_SERVER: 'ssl://your-license-server.company.com:443'
```

:::info Using "protected" variables will make them available only to protected branches

Make sure you unchecked the "protected" checkbox for these variables if you want them to be
available for all branches and merge requests.

:::

**No need** to set `UNITY_EMAIL`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`, or `UNITY_SERIAL` if you exclusively use the
license server method.

You're all set! The pipeline will use the server to activate Unity automatically. 🎉

---

## Debugging activation Locally with Docker

To debug or confirm activation locally (instead of pushing every time), you can run:

```bash
UNITY_VERSION=2022.3.12f1
IMAGE=unityci/editor
IMAGE_VERSION=3
DOCKER_IMAGE="$IMAGE:$UNITY_VERSION-base-$IMAGE_VERSION"

docker run -it --rm \
  -e "UNITY_EMAIL=username@example.com" \
  -e "UNITY_PASSWORD=example_password" \
  -e "UNITY_SERIAL=EXA-MPLE-SERI-ALKE-Y123" \
  -v "$(pwd):/root/project" \
  $DOCKER_IMAGE \
  bash

# Then inside the container, run:
xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args='-screen 0 640x480x24' \
  unity-editor \
  -logFile /dev/stdout \
  -batchmode \
  -nographics \
  -username "$UNITY_EMAIL" -password "$UNITY_PASSWORD" -serial "$UNITY_SERIAL"
```

If it finishes without errors, a `.ulf` should be located in
`/root/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`. You can use or reference that file in your GitLab
environment.

:::caution Security Warning

Executing shell commands directly in your terminal can expose your credentials in your shell
history. To avoid this, consider writing the commands to a shell script and executing the script
instead.

:::

## Next Steps

Once your license is activated in GitLab CI, you can:

- Run **Unit tests** with the `test` job in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- Create **Builds** for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, WebGL).
- Deploy or publish artifacts (e.g. WebGL to GitLab Pages).
- Explore advanced usage (e.g., coverage reports, caching, license server expansions).
