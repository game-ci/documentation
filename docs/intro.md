title: Welcome to GameCI

This site hosts all documentation for GameCI, and will help you setup Continuous Integration for your game projects.

Continuous Integration is a widely-used practice where automated pipelines check the
  latest code changes actually work, before merging them into the main branch. This helps developers stay in the flow and release faster and (ultimately) with more confidence.

Follow the development on [GitHub](https://github.com/game-ci/documentation).
