## What is GameCI?

GameCI is a community of game developers aiming to automate the process of creating and maintaining
games. It is also a set of tools related to CI/CD process that can be used by game developers.

## What is GameCI's goal?

- Making Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery more accessible to game developers
- Providing tools and resources to automate game development and deployment process
- Having fun doing it

## What does CI stand for in GameCI?

Did you know that `.ci` in [game.ci](https://game.ci/) is
[the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Côte d'Ivoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ci)?
In our case, it is also the abbreviation of Continuous Integration.

## What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery is a process that allows developers to build and
deploy software without having to manually intervene each time there is a change. Learn more on
[Wikipedia: CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)

## What game engines are supported?

Right now, GameCI only supports **[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)**. We see a bright future with
GameCI's integration with other game engines or simply put, building a community of people who are
interested in automation around game development.

### Recommendations for other game engines

For **[Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com/)**, we recommend you have a look at
[unrealcontainers](https://unrealcontainers.com) from our friend [Adam Rehn](https://adamrehn.com/).

For **[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)**, there are multiple options available. We know about
[abarichello/godot-ci](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci) from
[Artur Barichello](https://barichello.me/).

For **[MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/)**, there is this amazing guide on
[Lean MonoGame - Automate Release](https://learn-monogame.github.io/how-to/automate-release/) from
[Jean-David Moisan (Apostolique)](https://jeandavidmoisan.com/)

## Why use GameCI for Unity?

We want developers to concentrate on their game development, not on the stuff of CI/CD. Having a
CI/CD pipeline setup can benefit developers, but also artists, designers, Q/A and testers by
providing game builds faster and automatically. We have a large community of developers who are
using GameCI on a daily basis. We have community driven documentation to help you get started.
Everything we provide is free and open source.

## How does GameCI for Unity work?

We provide ready to use docker images published to docker hub with Unity pre-installed and ready to
run. This is especially useful for CI/CD pipelines where you don't want to waste time installing
Unity each time. The main goal is to use these images as part of a pipeline you own. You can find a
list of [all supported Unity versions here][unity-docker-versions]. We have a documentation website
providing complete examples of working pipelines for building, testing and publishing games using
major CI/CD platforms such as [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions),
[Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

We rely on the community to help us maintain and improve the images.

## Which CI/CD platforms are supported by GameCI for Unity?

Right now, we have official support for the following CI/CD platforms:

- **[Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)**
- **[Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/)**
- **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)**

## Can I use GameCI for Unity with `<insert other CI/CD service here>`?

This question is often ask for these CI/CD services:

- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
- [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)
- [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/)
- [Drone.io](https://www.drone.io/)

If the service you want to use supports Docker (the above list does), then chances are it will work,
but we might not have official support for it. Your best bet is to translate the
[GameCI gitlab-ci unity example project](https://unity-ci.com/docs/gitlab/example-project) to your
desired CI/CD service provider. Caution: if this is your first time using GameCI, you might want to
try officially supported services first. The easiest one is Github Actions.

We are also working on a **GameCI for Unity CLI** which will make it easier to integrate with any
CI/CD service. See our [Roadmap v3.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/game-ci/projects/4).

### Azure devOps

You might also want to have a look at [Unity Tools for Azure DevOps](https://unitydevops.com/)

## Which Unity versions are supported?

You can find [all supported Unity versions here][unity-docker-versions].

## What Unity build targets are supported?

You can find a list of succeeding pipelines for
[supported build targets in game-ci/unity-actions's ReadMe](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-actions#unity-actions).

We have linux and windows based docker images to support as many build targets as possible. This
includes the following build targets:

- WebGL
- Windows Mono
- Linux Mono
- macOS Mono
- Windows IL2CPP
- Linux IL2CPP
- macOS IL2CPP
- Android
- iOS
- Universal Windows Platform
- AppleTV

You can find a list of build targets on Unity's website:
[Unity Build Targets](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BuildTarget.html)

## Do you support Unity IL2CPP builds?

Yes, we do, but there are limitations. See
[Docker images limited IL2CPP support](/docs/docker/docker-images#limited-il2cpp-support)

## Do you have macOS based docker images for Unity?

No, we don't as it is currently not possible to build macos based images. If this is something you
are interested in, have a look at [macOS Containers initiative](https://macoscontainers.org/).

## Do I need a mac to build for iOS?

Yes, but not for all steps. You will only need a mac for building the generated Xcode project. Unity
on linux can generate an xcode project.

## Do you have docker images for alpha and beta versions of Unity?

No, you can learn why by looking at the following issue:
[game-ci/docker - Support alpha and beta versions of Unity #50](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/issues/50)

## Unity just released a new version, do you have a docker image for it?

Most likely yes. We have automated pipelines watching every 15 minutes for new releases of Unity.
Jobs are then created on github to build and push the docker images to docker hub. You can find the
status of the images on [the supported Unity versions page][unity-docker-versions].

## How does Unity activation work?

### The `machine-id`

Unity has several activation methods, but they all share the same concept. Unity uses the
`machine-id` to identify the user. This is usually unique per machine. On linux, the `machine-id` is
located here:

- `/etc/machine-id`
- `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`

Using a different `machine-id` will cause Unity to require a new activation.

To make it easier to use GameCI, we hardcoded the `machine-id` in all the docker images we publish,
[see Ubuntu's base Dockerfile](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/blob/main/images/ubuntu/base/Dockerfile#L67-L68).

This makes it easier to upgrade from one version of Unity to another as you will not need to
re-activate.

### I'm having troubles with Unity activation, what should I do?

Have a look at the Have a look at the [troubleshooting / common issues][common-issues] page.

## Can I use a free Unity license to build my project?

Yes

## Can I use a Unity Pro serial to build my project?

Yes

## Can I run multiple builds in parallel using Unity?

Yes, but have a look at
[Limitations: Concurrent builds on Windows and MacOS](/docs/docker/docker-images#concurrent-builds-on-windows-and-macos)

## How long does it take for a new version of Unity to become available as a Docker image?

We have automated pipelines that check for new releases of Unity every 15 minutes. Once a new release is detected, a job is created on GitHub to build and publish a new Docker image to Docker Hub. When the version is available on the Unity's download page, it usually takes a few hours for the new version to become available on Docker Hub. However, the exact time it takes for a new version to become available as a Docker image can vary depending on several factors, such as the time it takes to build the images, the availability of the new version on the Unity download page.

We have a discord channel which you can watch to be notified of new versions detected by our bot here: [#new-versions](https://discord.com/channels/710946343828455455/731947345478156391). You will need to join our [discord server](https://game.ci/discord) first.

## How does the Docker image publication process work?

The Docker image publication process involves several steps. First, we detect a new release of Unity based on [Unity's Archive page](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) and we trigger a build job on GitHub. Next, the build job uses Unity Hub to install Unity and the required packages and builds new Docker images for each supported target platforms. The new image is then tagged and pushed to Docker Hub, where it is publicly available for download.

## Where is the source of truth for the process of publishing Docker images?

The source of truth for the process of publishing Docker images is [Unity's Archive page](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). We use automated scripts to detect new releases on this page and trigger the build process for new Docker images. However, Unity may occasionally release updates that are not immediately available on their download page, which can cause a delay in the availability of new Docker images.

If you are currently using a recent unity version from Unity Hub that is not yet available on the [Unity's Archive page](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive), you can usually roll back to previous version which is most likely already available, or you can wait a few hours until Unity publishes the new version on its download page and wait for our pipelines to finish building and publishing the images.

## How much does it cost to use GameCI for Unity?

GameCI is free and open source software. Depending on the CI/CD service you use, you can pay for
build minutes but you can also use your own machines to build and test your project.

Most CI/CD service providers offer a free tier with free build minutes for private projects. If you
are building an open source project, it's often all free. ❤️

[gitlab.com/game-ci/](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/). If you still have problems, you can open an
issue on the related project. Still unsure? You can visit us on our [discord server][discord].

## Why is it so long to get support?

We are a small community of developers who are trying to make the world a better place. We are not
doing this for the money and no one is being paid for the support. This is all a community effort to
end up with games that are less buggy ;). Don't hold your breath and be nice with people helping
you. ❤️

## Do you offer premium support?

We don't offer premium support. We do offer free support for the community as a best-effort.

## I have too much money, and I like your projects, how can I help?

We have an [opencollective page](https://opencollective.com/game-ci) where you can donate. The
donations are used to pay for the costs of the infrastructure, domains and the servers (which we
kept to a very reasonable price, thanks to all the free services for open source projects). We might
also use the money to pay for improving our visuals or anything that could help us become a better
community. It is also possible that we send gifts to major contributors, who knows? ❤️

## Do you have a roadmap?

Yes, see our [Roadmap v3.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/game-ci/projects/4).
