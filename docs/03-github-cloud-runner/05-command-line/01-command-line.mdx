# Command Line (Preview)

You can install Game CI locally and start cloud runner jobs from the command line or by integrating
your own tools. All parameters in [Configuration](configuration) can be specified as command line
input fields.

# Install

Currently (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/game-ci/unity-builder.git
yarn install
yarn run cli -m {mode parameter} --projectPath {Your project path} {... other command line parameters}
```

# Planned (does not work currently)

We plan to offer support for Game CI via Deno. This will enable fast, typescript native runtime and
you will be able to access this via the following:

```bash
dpx game-ci build
```

# Help

_You can run `yarn run cli -h` or `yarn run cli --help` to List all modes and paramters with
descriptions_

# Main Command Parameters

- Default: `cli` (runs a standard build workflow)
- [Garbage Collection Modes](#../05-advanced-topics/08-cloud-runner-model/garbage-collection)

# Avoiding long parameters for commands

You can avoid specifying lots of command line input for credentials (e.g all unity authentication
and cloud provider settings) by using environment variables or
[the input override feature](advanced-topics/input-override#example) to shorten commands
signficantly.

This enables you to provide a command to pull input, e.g you can pull from a file or from a secret
manager.

```bash
yarn run cli --populateOverride true --readInputFromOverrideList UNITY_EMAIL,UNITY_SERIAL,UNITY_PASSWORD --readInputOverrideCommand="gcloud secrets versions access 1 --secret=\"{0}\""
```

```bash
aws-list-stacks
```

```bash
