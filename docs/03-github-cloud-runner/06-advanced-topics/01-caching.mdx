# Caching

Cloud Runner supports two main caching modes:

- Standard Caching
- Retained Workspace

_You can even mix the two by specifying a "MaxRetainedWorkspaces" parameter. Above the max
concurrent_ _jobs a new job will use standard caching._

## Standard Caching

#### What is cached between builds

- LFS files
- Unity Library folder

## Retained Workspace
