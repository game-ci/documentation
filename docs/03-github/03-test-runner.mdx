# Test runner

Running your test suite in an automated workflow helps increase certainty when merging.

Use [Unity - Test runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner) to run your
Unity tests.

_Optional_ to include test coverage, use
[Unity - Code Coverage](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/index.html)

## Basic setup

By default, the test runner will run both `playmode` and `editmode` tests.

Create or edit the file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` and add a job to it.

#### Personal license

Personal licenses require a one-time manual activation step.

Make sure you
[acquire and activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file) your
license file and add it as a secret.

Then, define the test step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  env:
    UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Professional license

Make sure you have set up these variables in the activation step.

- `UNITY_EMAIL` (should contain the email address for your Unity account)
- `UNITY_PASSWORD` (the password that you use to login to Unity)
- `UNITY_SERIAL` (the serial provided by Unity)

Define the test step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  env:
    UNITY_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
    UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
    UNITY_SERIAL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_SERIAL }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## License Server

If you host your own Unity license server you can provide its url using `unityLicensingServer`. A
floating license will be acquired before the tests run, and returned after.

Example of use:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
  with:
    targetPlatform: WebGL
    unityLicensingServer: [url to your license server]
```

That is all you need to test your project.

## Testing Unity packages

The test runner offers basic support for testing Unity packages, with [a few caveats](#caveats).

### Additional setup

After performing [Basic setup](#basic-setup), three extra steps are required for testing Unity
packages.

#### Setting packageMode

To indicate that the test runner is being run for a Unity package rather than a Unity project, set
the [`packageMode`](#packagemode) configuration option to `true`.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    packageMode: true
```

#### Passing a unityVersion

Make sure that you explicitly pass the [`unityVersion`](#unityversion) argument, as it's necessary
for the test runner to test Unity packages.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    unityVersion: [your desired Unity version]
```

See the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/227) for more details on
why this is necessary.

#### Choosing a package directory

Make sure that the directory of the package being tested is **not** the same as the repository's
root directory. This condition will cause the test runner to hang and fail.

Currently, the only known workarounds for this failure are these two options:

1. Restructure your repository to place the package being tested in a subdirectory of the
   repository's root directory.
2. Somehow temporarily move the package being tested to a subdirectory of the repository's root
   directory within the GitHub Workflow where you're using the test runner.

Whichever workaround you choose, make sure that the [`projectPath`](#projectpath) corresponds to
wherever the package being tested is located at the time the test runner is called in your GitHub
Workflow.

See the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/223) for more details and
potential workarounds.

### Caveats

- As stated above, the action will fail if the directory of the package being tested is the same as
  the root directory of the repository (this issue is being tracked
  [here](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/223)).
- As stated above, excluding `unityVersion` or passing a `unityVersion` configuration of `auto` when
  testing a Unity Package will cause the test runner to fail. The Unity version must be manually set
  in the configuration options (this issue is being tracked
  [here](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/227)).
- The test runner can only test packages on Linux runners - Windows runners are currently not
  supported (this issue is being tracked
  [here](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/224))
- Packages with dependencies outside of the Unity Registry have not been tested an may or may not
  work with the test runner (this issue is being tracked
  [here](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/225)).
- There is currently no caching set up for the testing of Unity packages (this issue is being
  tracked [here](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-test-runner/issues/226)).
- If using the `customImage` parameter to use a custom Docker image to test the package, that image
  must have [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed, or else the test runner will error. It
  is used to add the package being tested to a temporary Unity project's package manifest at
  runtime.

## Viewing test results

The test results can be viewed from a
[GitHub Status Check](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks).

To get this functionality, simply provide the
[GitHub Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret)
in order to view the tests results from
[a check run](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api#about-check-runs).

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If you choose not to provide the `githubToken`, you may still upload the artifacts in order to
access them.

## Storing test results

To be able to access the test results, they need to be uploaded as artifacts.

To do this, it is recommended to use the official Github Actions
[upload artifact action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact).

By default, Test Runner outputs its results to a folder named `artifacts`.

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Test results
    path: artifacts
```

Test results can now be downloaded as `Artifacts` in the `Actions` tab.

#### Specifying artifacts folder

You can specify a different `artifactsPath` in the test runner and reference this path using the
`id` of the test step.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  id: myTestStep
```

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Test results
    path: ${{ steps.myTestStep.outputs.artifactsPath }}
```

### Getting coverage results

The results for the test code coverage are stored in the folder `CodeCoverage` and the path can be
read by the step's `outputs.coveragePath`. These coverage options can be configured as part of the
test and by default will create an XML and HTML web page reports.

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Coverage results
    path: ${{ steps.myTestStep.outputs.coveragePath }}
```

The coverage results will be generated for whatever tests were selected to run. If both `editmode`
and `playmode` are selected by using `all`, then the results will have the combined coverage of both
test modes.

_Note_ Coverage results are generated with root permission so to move or edit the output in later
steps you may need to use elevated permissions such as `sudo`.

## Caching

In order to make test runs (and builds) faster, you can cache Library files from previous runs.

To do so, simply add Github Actions' official
[cache action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache) before any unity steps.

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: path/to/your/project/Library
    key: Library-MyProjectName-TargetPlatform
    restore-keys: |
      Library-MyProjectName-
      Library-
```

This simple addition could speed up your test runs by more than 50%.

Note that caching in this manner only applies to testing Unity **Projects**, not Unity **Packages**
(see [Caveats](#caveats)).

## Configuration options

Below options can be specified under `with:` for the `unity-test-runner` action.

#### unityVersion

Version of Unity to use for testing the project. Use "auto" to get from your
ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt. ⚠️ If testing a Unity Package, this field is required and cannot
be set to "auto".

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `auto`_

#### customImage

Specific docker image that should be used for testing the project. If packageMode is true, this
image must have [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    customImage: 'unityci/editor:2020.1.14f1-base-0'
```

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### projectPath

Specify the path to your Unity project or package to be tested. The path should be relative to the
root of your project.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `<your project root>`_

#### customParameters

Custom parameters to configure the test runner.

For example, you may refer to the
[Unity Test Framework command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/reference-command-line.html)
for options that could help with configuring your tests.

Parameters must start with a hyphen (`-`) and may be followed by a value (without hyphen).

Parameters without a value will be considered booleans (with a value of true).

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    customParameters: -profile SomeProfile -someBoolean -someValue exampleValue
```

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### testMode

The type of tests to be run by the test runner.

Options are: `All`, `PlayMode`, and `EditMode`.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `All`_

#### artifactsPath

Path where the test results should be stored.

In this folder a folder will be created for every test mode.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `artifacts`_

#### coverageOptions

Options for configuring code coverage, this configures the `-coverageOptions` parameter described
unity's CodeCoverage documentation:
[Using Code Coverage in batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html).

By default, this parameter is configured to generate an HTML report with additional metrics. This
should be fine for most projects, but the webpage report can be quite large for projects with
hundreds or thousands of large files.

You can add arguments for `assemblyFilters` to specify an assembly to filter files that results are
generated for. This is commonly used to ignore test files or external libraries. See the
[Using Code Coverage in batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html).
For example, you can add the argument `assemblyFilters:+my.assembly.*` to only include files in the
assemblies that match `+my.assembly.*`, the `*` is a wildcard. This will require making an assembly
definition to manage scripts, see Unity's documentation on
[Assembly definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html)
for how to create and manage assembly definitions.

To get coverage when testing a package, make sure you pass assemblies from the package you want
covered to the `assemblyFilters` option.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:**
`generateAdditionalMetrics;generateHtmlReport;generateBadgeReport`_

#### useHostNetwork

Initializes Docker using the host network.

This is useful if Unity needs to access a local server that was started as part of your workflow.

Options are: "true", "false"

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `false`_

#### sshAgent

SSH Agent path to forward to the container.

This is useful if your manifest has a dependency on a private GitHub repo.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** ``_

#### gitPrivateToken

GitHub Private Access Token (PAT) to pull from GitHub.

This is useful if your manifest has a dependency on a private GitHub repo.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** ``_

#### githubToken

Token to authorize access to the GitHub REST API. If provided, a check run will be created with the
test results.

It is recommended to use `githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, but creating the check from
[a fork of your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token)
may require using a
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).

Reference the [GitHub Checks API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks) for details
on
[creating CI tests with the Checks API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-ci-tests-with-the-checks-api).

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** ``_

#### checkName

Name for the check run that is created when a github token is provided.

It may be useful to customize the check name if, for example, you have a job matrix with multiple
unity versions.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `Test Results`_

#### packageMode

Whether the tests are being run for a Unity package instead of a Unity project.

If true, the action can only be run on Linux runners, and any custom docker image passed to this
action must have [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed.

NOTE: may not work properly for packages with dependencies outside of the Unity Registry.

See [Testing Unity packages](#testing-unity-packages) for more information.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `false`_

## Complete example

A complete workflow that tests all modes separately could look like this:

```yaml
name: Test project

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  testAllModes:
    name: Test in ${{ matrix.testMode }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-project
        testMode:
          - playmode
          - editmode
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}/Library
          key: Library-${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          restore-keys: |
            Library-
      - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
        id: tests
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          testMode: ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          artifactsPath: ${{ matrix.testMode }}-artifacts
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          checkName: ${{ matrix.testMode }} Test Results
          coverageOptions: 'generateAdditionalMetrics;generateHtmlReport;generateBadgeReport;assemblyFilters:+my.assembly.*'
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: Test results for ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          path: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.artifactsPath }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: Coverage results for ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          path: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.coveragePath }}
```

## Complete Example (Testing a Package)

A complete workflow that tests all modes separately (for a package rather than a project) could look
like this:

```yaml
name: Test package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  testAllModes:
    name: Test in ${{ matrix.testMode }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-package
        unityVersion: '2020.3.0f1' # some version must be included for package testing
        testMode:
          - playmode
          - editmode
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
      - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
        id: tests
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
          testMode: ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          artifactsPath: ${{ matrix.testMode }}-artifacts
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          checkName: ${{ matrix.testMode }} Test Results
          coverageOptions: 'generateAdditionalMetrics;generateHtmlReport;generateBadgeReport;assemblyFilters:+my.assembly.*'
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: Test results for ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          path: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.artifactsPath }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: Coverage results for ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          path: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.coveragePath }}
```
