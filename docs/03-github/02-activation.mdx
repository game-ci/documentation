# Activation

All Unity actions require activation.

### Choosing the Right Activation Method

To activate Unity, select the method that matches your license type:

- If you're using the **free version**, follow the steps for a
  [Personal License](#personal-license).
- If you're using the **paid version**, such as Unity Plus or Pro, refer to the instructions for a
  [Professional License](#professional-license).
- For organizations using a **license server**, you can provide the server's URL as detailed in the
  [License Server](#license-server) section.

Choose the appropriate method to ensure your Unity environment is activated and ready for use.

## Personal license

Follow these steps if you are using the free version of Unity.

> _**Note:** Do not follow the steps for the personal license if you have a professional license._

### Mental Model

1. **Activate the license locally**: Use Unity Hub to create a `.ulf` license file linked to your
   Unity account.
2. **Add the license to GitHub**: Store the `.ulf` file and Unity credentials as GitHub secrets for
   use in CI builds.

### Setting Up Your Unity License

1. **Install Unity Hub**: Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) on your local
   machine.
2. **Log in to Unity Hub**: Use the Unity account linked to your CI setup to log in. Ensure you're
   using the correct account to activate the intended license.
3. **Activate Your License**: Manually activate by navigating to:

   - `Unity Hub` > `Preferences` > `Licenses` and click the `Add` button
   - Select **Get a free personal license**.

   :::info Ensure File Creation

   Even if a license appears in Unity Hub, a `.ulf` file may not have been created. To ensure the
   file is generated, make sure to click the `Add` button and proceed with the activation steps. Do
   not skip this step.

4. **Locate the `.ulf` file**: Depending on your operating system, the Unity license file will be
   located in one of these paths:

   - Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`
   - Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`

   If you have trouble locating the `.ulf` file, follow these steps:

   - **Check activation**: Ensure you’ve logged into Unity Hub and completed the step "3. Activate
     Your License".
   - **Reveal hidden files**: These folders may be hidden by default, so enable the option to view
     hidden files in your file explorer.
   - **Use any platform**: Licenses are not tied to a specific Unity version or platform. You can
     activate the license on any operating system, such as Windows, and use it for builds on another
     platform, like Ubuntu. Simply retrieve the `.ulf` file from the platform most convenient for
     you.

5. **Add Secrets to GitHub**: Navigate to `GitHub` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` >
   `Secrets and Variables` > `Actions`. Then, create the following secrets:

   - **`UNITY_LICENSE`**: Copy and paste the contents of your `.ulf` license file.
   - **`UNITY_EMAIL`**: Enter the email address associated with your Unity account.
   - **`UNITY_PASSWORD`**: Enter the password for your Unity account.

**GameCI does not acquire nor store your Unity email, password, or license file contents. They are
required for activating the license during build and test steps.**

## Professional license

1. Subscribe to Unity Plus or Unity Pro, and get your Serial Key from the
   [Unity Subscriptions page](https://id.unity.com/en/subscriptions)
2. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets`
3. Create the following secrets;
   - `UNITY_SERIAL` - _(Add the serial key from step 1 that looks like
     `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)_
   - `UNITY_EMAIL` - _(Add the email address that you use to login to Unity)_
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to login to Unity)_

**GameCI does not acquire nor store your Unity email, password, or serial number. They are required
for activating the license during build and test steps.**

> _**Note:** Do NOT follow the steps for the personal license if you have a professional license._

## License Server

If you host your own Unity license server you can provide its url using `unityLicensingServer`. A
floating license will be acquired before the build, and returned after.

Example of use:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v4
  with:
    targetPlatform: WebGL
    unityLicensingServer: [url to your license server]
```

## Optional steps

- Verify your license using [Activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-activate).
- When using a pro license also use
  [Return License](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-return-license) to free up the
  license allocation after usage.

> _**Note:** Test runner and Builder already include these steps._

## Next steps

The license can now be used in test and build steps.

You are now ready to start configuring these.
