# Getting started

Unity Actions provide the fastest and **easiest** way to automatically test and build any Unity
project.

There are a few parts to setting up a workflow. Steps may slightly differ depending on each license
type.

## Mental model

#### Overall steps

1. Understand how [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) work.
2. Configure a license for Unity.
3. Set up a workflow for your project.
4. Result: Merge pull requests with more confidence.

#### Setting up a workflow

Setting up a workflow is easy!

Create a file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository and configure the following
steps;

1. Checkout your repository using [Checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).
2. Cache Unity Library folder using [Cache](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
3. Configure your test job using
   [Test Runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner).
4. Configure your build job using [Builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-builder).
5. Deploy your application.

_**Note:** all steps will be explained in the next chapters._

## Support

#### First time using GitHub Actions?

Read the official documentation on how to setup a
[workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow).

Any subsequent steps assume you have read the above.

#### Supported versions

Unity Actions are based on the [unity3d](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d) images from
[GabLeRoux](https://github.com/GabLeRoux). Any version in the
[list](https://hub.docker.com/r/gableroux/unity3d/tags) can be used to test and build projects.

It's generally considered good practice to use the same Unity version for Unity Actions as you do to
develop your project.

## Simple example

Below is a simple example. It is **recommended** to start from here.

This example assumes that your Unity project is in the root of your repository.

```yaml
name: Actions 😎

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [main] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build my project ✨
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true

      # Cache
      - uses: actions/cache@v1.1.0
        with:
          path: Library
          key: Library

      # Test
      - name: Run tests
        uses: webbertakken/unity-test-runner@v1.7
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1

      # Build
      - name: Build project
        uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@v1.5
        with:
          unityVersion: 2019.2.11f1
          targetPlatform: WebGL

      # Output
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```

## Advanced example

To get an idea of how to create a more advanced workflows, have a look at the example below.

> _Note: this repository tests this workflow_

```yaml
name: Actions 😎

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [main] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  buildAndTestForSomePlatforms:
    name: Build for ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }} on version ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-project
        unityVersion:
          - 2019.2.11f1
        targetPlatform:
          - StandaloneOSX # Build a macOS standalone (Intel 64-bit).
          - StandaloneWindows64 # Build a Windows 64-bit standalone.
          - StandaloneLinux64 # Build a Linux 64-bit standalone.
          - iOS # Build an iOS player.
          - WebGL # WebGL.

        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}/Library

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
