# Builder

Building the project as part of a workflow may help to create mind-space and focus on the project
itself.

Use [Unity - Builder ](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-builder) to automatically build
Unity projects for different platforms.

## Basic setup

By default, the enabled scenes from the project's settings will be built.

Create or edit the file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` and add a job to it.

#### Personal License

Personal licenses require a one-time manual activation step (per unity version).

Make sure you
[acquire and activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file) your
license file and add it as a secret.

Then, define the build step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  env:
    UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    unityVersion: 2020.X.XXXX
    targetPlatform: WebGL
```

#### Professional license

Make sure you have set up these variables in the activation step.

- `UNITY_EMAIL` (should contain the email address for your Unity account)
- `UNITY_PASSWORD` (the password that you use to login to Unity)
- `UNITY_SERIAL` (the serial provided by Unity)

Define the build step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  env:
    UNITY_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
    UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
    UNITY_SERIAL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_SERIAL }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    unityVersion: 2020.X.XXXX
    targetPlatform: WebGL
```

That is all you need to build your project.

## Storing the build

To be able to access your built files, they need to be uploaded as artifacts. To do this it is
recommended to use Github Actions official
[upload artifact action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact) after any
build action.

By default, Builder outputs it's builds to a folder named `build`.

Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: Build
    path: build
```

Builds can now be downloaded as Artifacts in the Actions tab.

## Caching

In order to make builds run faster, you can cache Library files from previous builds. To do so
simply add Github Actions official [cache action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache)
before any unity steps.

Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v1.1.0
  with:
    path: path/to/your/project/Library
    key: Library-MyProjectName-TargetPlatform
    restore-keys: |
      Library-MyProjectName-
      Library-
```

This simple addition could speed up your build by more than 50%.

## Configuration options

Below options can be specified under `with:` for the `unity-builder` action.

#### projectPath

Specify the path to your Unity project to be built. The path should be relative to the root of your
project.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `<your project root>`_

#### unityVersion

Version of Unity to use for building the project. Use "auto" to get from your
ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `auto`_

#### targetPlatform

Platform that the build should target.

Must be one of the [allowed values](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BuildTarget.html)
listed in the Unity scripting manual.

_**required:** `true`_

#### buildName

Name of the build. Also the folder in which the build will be stored within `buildsPath`.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `<build_target>`_

#### buildsPath

Path where the builds should be stored.

In this folder a folder will be created for every targetPlatform.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `build`_

#### buildMethod

Custom command to run your build.

There are two conditions for a custom buildCommand:

- Must reference a valid path to a `static` method.
- The class must reside in the `Assets/Editor` directory.

_**example:**_

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    buildMethod: EditorNamespace.BuilderClassName.StaticBulidMethod
```

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** Built-in script that will run a build out of the box._

#### versioning

Configure a specific versioning strategy

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    versioning: Semantic
```

Find the available strategies below:

##### Semantic

Versioning out of the box! **(recommended)**

> Compatible with **all platforms**. Does **not** modify your repository. Requires **zero
> configuration**.

How it works:

> Generates a version based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Follows
> `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for example `0.17.2`. The latest tag dictates `<major>.<minor>`
> (defaults to 0.0 for no tag). The number of commits (since the last tag, if any) is used for
> `<patch>`.

No configuration required.

##### Custom

Allows specifying a custom version in the `version` field. **(advanced users)**

> This strategy is useful when your project or pipeline has some kind of orchestration that
> determines the versions.

##### None

No version will be set by Builder. **(not recommended)**

> Not recommended unless you generate a new version in a pre-commit hook. Manually setting versions
> is error-prone.

#### androidVersionCode

Configure the android `versionCode`.

When not specified, the version code is generated from the version using the
`major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch` scheme;

#### androidAppBundle

Set this flag to `true` to build '.aab' instead of '.apk'.

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    androidAppBundle: true
    androidKeystoreName: user.keystore
    androidKeystoreBase64: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}
    androidKeystorePass: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASS }}
    androidKeyaliasName: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYALIAS_NAME }}
    androidKeyaliasPass: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYALIAS_PASS }}
```

You should also set all the Android Keystore options (see below).

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `false`_

#### androidKeystoreName

Configure the android `keystoreName`. Must be provided if configuring the below keystore options.

For this to take effect, you must enable `Custom Keystore` in your
[Android Player settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html). The
default build script overrides the other keystore settings with these keystore options.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### androidKeystoreBase64

Configure the base64 contents of the android keystore file. You should get this with
`base64 $androidKeystoreName`

The contents will be decoded from base64 using
`echo $androidKeystoreBase64 | base64 --decode > $projectPath/$androidKeystoreName`

It is recommended to use
[GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### androidKeystorePass

Configure the android `keystorePass`. Recommended to use GitHub Secrets.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### androidKeyaliasName

Configure the android `keyaliasName`. Recommended to use GitHub Secrets.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### androidKeyaliasPass

Configure the android `keyaliasPass`. Recommended to use GitHub Secrets.

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### allowDirtyBuild

Allows the branch of the build to be dirty, and still generate the build.

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    allowDirtyBuild: true
```

Note that it is generally bad practice to modify your branch in a CI Pipeline. However there are
exceptions where this might be needed. (use with care).

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `false`_

#### customParameters

Custom parameters to configure the build.

Parameters must start with a hyphen (`-`) and may be followed by a value (without hyphen).

Parameters without a value will be considered booleans (with a value of true).

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    customParameters: -profile SomeProfile -someBoolean -someValue exampleValue
```

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

#### customImage

Specific docker image that should be used for building the project.

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  with:
    customImage: 'unityci/editor:2020.1.14f1-base-0'
```

_**required:** `false`_ _**default:** `""`_

## Outputs

Below are outputs that can be accessed by using `${{ steps.myBuildStep.outputs.outputName }}`, where
`myBuildStep` is the id of the Builder step, and `outputName` is the name of the output.

#### buildVersion

Returns the version that was generated by Builder, following the strategy configured for
`versioning`.

```yaml
- uses: webbertakken/unity-builder@1.5
  id: myBuildStep
- run: echo 'Project Version: ${{ steps.myBuildStep.outputs.buildVersion }}'
```
