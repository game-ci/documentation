# Deploy to Steam

This page assumes you are registered as a [partner](https://partner.steamgames.com/) with Steam and
that you are familiar with
[using SteamPipe to upload your builds to Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading).

### 1. Create a Steam Build Account

Create a specialised builder account that only has access to `Edit App Metadata` and
`Publish App Changes To Steam`.

See [the docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading#Build_Account).

### 2. Add jobs to main.yml

```yaml title=".github/workflows/main.yml"
jobs:
  buildForWindowsAndLinux:
    name: Build for ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        targetPlatform:
          - StandaloneWindows64 # Build a Windows 64-bit standalone.
          - StandaloneLinux64 # Build a Linux 64-bit standalone.
    outputs:
      buildVersion: ${{ steps.build.outputs.buildVersion }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          lfs: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: Library
          key:
            Library-${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}-${{ hashFiles('Assets/**', 'Packages/**',
            'ProjectSettings/**') }}
          restore-keys: |
            Library-${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}-
            Library-
      - uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
        id: build
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          targetPlatform: ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
          versioning: Semantic
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: Build-${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
          path: build/${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
  deployToSteam:
    needs: [buildForWindowsAndLinux]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Download StandaloneWindows64 Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: Build-StandaloneWindows64
          path: build/StandaloneWindows64
      - name: Download StandaloneLinux64 Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: Build-StandaloneLinux64
          path: build/StandaloneLinux64
      - uses: game-ci/steam-deploy@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.STEAM_USERNAME }}
          configVdf: ${{ secrets.STEAM_CONFIG_VDF}}
          appId: ${{ secrets.STEAM_APP_ID }}
          buildDescription: v${{ needs.buildForWindowsAndLinux.outputs.buildVersion }}
          rootPath: build
          depot1Path: StandaloneWindows64
          depot2Path: StandaloneLinux64
          releaseBranch: prerelease
```

### 3. Add GitHub Secrets

- **STEAM_USERNAME**: The username of the Steam Build Account that you created in step 1.
- **STEAM_CONFIG_VDF**: See the step "Setup Steam Authentication" below.
- **STEAM_APP_ID**: The identifier of your app on steam. You can find it on your
  [dashboard](https://partner.steamgames.com/dashboard).

### 4. Setup Steam Authentication

Deploying to Steam requires using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) through Steam Guard. This means
that simply using username and password isn't enough to authenticate with Steam. However, it is
possible to go through the MFA process only once by following these steps:

1. Install [Valve's offical steamcmd](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading#1) on your
   local machine. All following steps will also be done on your local machine.
1. Try to login with `steamcmd +login <username> <password> +quit`, which may prompt for the MFA
   code. If so, type in the MFA code that was emailed to your builder account's email address.
1. Validate that the MFA process is complete by running `steamcmd +login <username> +quit` again. It
   should not ask for the MFA code again.
1. The folder from which you run `steamcmd` will now contain an updated `config/config.vdf` file.
   Use `cat config/config.vdf | base64 > config_base64.txt` to encode the file. Copy the contents of
   `config_base64.txt` to a GitHub Secret `STEAM_CONFIG_VDF`.
1. `If:` when running the action you recieve another MFA code via email, run
   `steamcmd +set_steam_guard_code <code>` on your local machine and repeat the `config.vdf`
   encoding and replace secret `STEAM_CONFIG_VDF` with its contents.

If your builder account uses MFA through the Steam Guard App, the `steam-deploy` app can use a TOTP
instead of the above configuration. Generating a TOTP is outside the scope of this guide, as it is
simpler to follow the above steps.

### 5. Additional Configuration

You can configure these to better match your use case.

#### totp

Deploys to Steam using a TOTP. If this is passed, `configVdf` is not required.

#### buildDescription

The identifier for this specific build, which helps you identify it in steam.

It is recommended to use the semantic version of the build for this.

#### rootPath

The root path to your builds. This is the base of which depots will search your files.

#### depot[X]Path

Where X is any number between 1 and 9 (inclusive both).

The relative path following your root path for the files to be included in this depot.

If your appId is 125000 then the depots 125001 ... 125009 will be assumed.

#### firstDepotIdOverride

You can use this to override the ID of the first depot in case the IDs do not start as described in
depot[X]Path (e.g. for DLCs).

If your firstDepotId is 125000 then, regardless of the used appId, the depots 125000 ... 125008 will
be assumed.

#### releaseBranch

The branch within steam that this build will be automatically put live on.

Note that the `default` branch
[has been observed to not work](https://github.com/game-ci/steam-deploy/issues/19) as a release
branch, presumably because it is potentially dangerous.
